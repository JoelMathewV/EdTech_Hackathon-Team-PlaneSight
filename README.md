## About the Project
When anyone wants to learn about a technology or wants to starts to learn something new, most probably he would be looking for it on YouTube. Why? because it is the best place for one to find videos and tutorials on any topic that they wish to learn for free. But the main drawback of learning from YouTube is that it's too much cluttered now and there are lot of videos on same topics which newbie gets overwhelmed at first to select which one to follow. With this project our aim is to organise the clutter in the YouTube and make it more approachable to find the resources from YouTube for all the newbies out there.
