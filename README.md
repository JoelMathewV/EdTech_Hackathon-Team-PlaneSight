## About the Project
When anyone wants to learn about a technology or wants to starts to learn something new, most probably he would be looking for it on YouTube. Why? because it is the best place for one to find videos and tutorials on any topic that they wish to learn for free. But the main drawback of learning from YouTube is that it's too much cluttered now and there are lot of videos on same topics which newbie gets overwhelmed at first to select which one to follow. With this project our aim is to organise the clutter in the YouTube and make it more approachable to find the resources from YouTube for all the newbies out there.

This project was first meant to address the topic "where to start" but as we went further with ideation we found out that the project is actually sovling ALL THE THREE PROBLEM STATEMENTS

1. It solves the "where to start" problem because at the core this project is meant to be used for all newbies and help them to not get lost on what to follow

2. It solves the "Organized learning" because our project's approach is to make a video playlist index which would be strictly made to for newbies to follow from zero-intermediate level or even advanced.

3. It solves "EdTech for Rural India" issue cause one of the main problems they face is they money, resources and right guidance. With our website we are tackling all those issues cause its free and open source, resources are organised for a newbie, the playlists are made by someone who have already followed it.
